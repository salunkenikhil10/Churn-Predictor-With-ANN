# Churn-Predictor-With-ANN
🧠 Predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow &amp; Keras. Includes complete data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a Flask-based web app for real-time churn prediction.
# Customer Churn Prediction using ANN and Flask

This project is a complete end-to-end churn prediction system using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. It predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on key features such as tenure, monthly charges, and total charges.

### 🔍 Features:
- Full **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and **outlier handling**
- Custom-built ANN using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Model evaluation with **confusion matrix**, **ROC AUC**, and **classification report**
- Interactive **Flask web app** with HTML & CSS frontend
- Accepts user inputs and predicts churn probability in real-time

### 📁 Tech Stack:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas / NumPy / Seaborn
- Flask (for web interface)
- HTML + CSS (form design)

### 💡 Business Use Case:
Companies can proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and take strategic actions to improve retention and revenue.
